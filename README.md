# rawproc
Raw processor and general image processor.

I wanted a simple raw processor.  Here it is.  It's primarily a desktop GUI application, but one day I'll make it tablet-
friendly.  It doesn't do image management. With the exception of saturation, denoise, and sharpen tools, it only does 
tone manipulation.  It saves the processing applied in the EXIF of the saved image because I do not like the sidecar 
concept.  It works internally with floating point pixel values.  Here's a list of the implemented manipulations:

- Add
- Black/White Point
- Colorspace
- Crop
- Curve
- Demosaic
- Denoise
- Exposure
- Gamma
- Grayscale Conversion
- G'MIC
- Highlight Recovery
- Lens Correction
- Redeye Correction
- Resize
- Rotate
- Saturation
- Script
- Sharpen
- Subtract
- Tone
- White Balance

You open an image, add whatever manipulations you want to apply to the list, then save the result.   You determine
the order of the manipulations.  Also, you have to deal with the raw image, in that the choices regarding white balance,
demosaic, colorspace conversion, and gamma are for you to make.  The input image is dark, so learn to deal with it.  
And, in doing so, you'll learn valuable things about digital images.

In the display, you can use the 't' key or double-click the upper-left thumbnail to toggle between a small repeat image for panning, a 255-value histogram, and no thumbnail.

So, you can open a RAW file, apply a list of manipulations, and save it as, say, a TIFF.  Then, using the "Open Source..." menu item,  you can select the saved TIFF, and rawproc will open the original RAW file and automatically apply the manipulation list saved in the TIFF.  The manipulations used to produce the TIFF are stored in its EXIF metadata.  This is my take on 'non-destructive' editing.

rawproc also implements what I call 'incremental processing', in that each added manipulation does its thing against the 
previous one and stores the result; adding a manipulation doesn't restart the whole processing chain, it just pulls the 
previous processed image and applies its manipulation.  If you go back and change one, it only has to process from that 
point forward.  This approach uses more memory, but at the benefit of less time to see the results of single manipulations.

The check box by each manipulation sets the display to that manipulation's result.  So, you can set the display and go to 
any previous (or subsequent) manipulation and play with it, seeing the result at the checked manipulation.  A kinda goofy
way to display, but I'm warming to it... :)

I started rawproc development with FreeImage, http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/.  It served well to flesh out 
the initial look and behavior of rawproc, but I encounterd significant hurdles with it and color management.  So, 
I ended up writing my own image library, gimage, https://github.com/butcherg/gimage.  That was a significant learning 
endeavor, but well worth the effort, as I now have high-quality image algorithms with OpenMP threading throughout, with 
color management tools to boot.  Also, gimage has only one internal tone representation, floating point.  Image
manipulations are a little slower as a result, but I've done some pixel-peep comparisons and the tone gradations do
look better.  double, float, or half floating point representations are selectable at compile-time; the 32-bit Windows 
installer version uses half because I ran into heap limits with a 32-bit executable.  I compile my Linux version with 
float; I can't see that using double provides any advantage worth the memory use for the tone ranges we work with in 
general purpose photography.

I offer no promise of support or enhancement, past offering the code on Github for you to fork. It is organized to compile 
with the GNU g++ compiler, either native on Linux OSs or Mingw32 on Windows platforms.  I've compiled and run executables 
on Ubuntu x86_64 and Windows 7, 8, and 10.

'img' is a command line program that uses the same image processing routines as rawproc. The only comprehensive 
documentation is the img.cpp source file.  You use it like this:

<pre>
img input.jpg resize:640,0 sharpen:1 output.jpg
</pre>

img will allow wildcards in the input and output filespecifications, so you can use it to apply processing to all 
images in a directory.  It will also read rawproc configuration files, so a workflow that starts with batch-produced JPEGs and continues with re-editing selected images in rawproc is seamless.

This code is essentially a hack; I started it with a wxDevC++ project, but abandoned that IDE some time ago.  I wrote code 
for things I could understand; and shamelessly copied code (e.g., spline.h) for things I didn't want to spend the time 
learning.  My C++ skills are spotty, and look a lot more like C in some places.  But I learned a ton about digital imaging
doing this, and I now have a tool I can use in the field to do what I'll call 'contact sheet' processing; at a 
later time I can go back to the JPEG I produced and extract the manipulation list, use it as the start for more 'quality' 
processing in Raw Therapee and GIMP.

If  you want to gripe or comment about rawproc, I'll be occasionally monitoring the pixels.us forums.  If I subsequently 
commit anything interesting to the respository, I'll shout it out there.

# Building rawproc

As of 2023-12-31, rawproc now has a CMake build system.  Along with it, rawproc was scrubbed to be able to use wxWidgets 3.0, the current version available in the Ubuntu/Debian package repositories.  Accordingly, you can now compile rawproc with (mostly) operating system packages, no need to compile wxWidgets (!)

The build instructions are now oriented to the new build system, but I'm leaving the autotools scripts in-place for the time being.

## Prerequisites:

First, C++17 is necessary after commit #133d19, 2022-05-23.  gcc 11 uses it by default, and you need gcc >= 8 to compile past that commit.

If you're on a Debian/Ubuntu or derivatives, install these packages:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev libpng-dev libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev liblcms2-dev libraw-dev liblensfun-dev liblensfun-data-v1 libexiv2-dev
</pre>

If you enable lensfun_dbupdate:

<pre>
sudo apt-get libcurl4-openssl-dev libarchive-dev
</pre>

If you enable G'MIC (using the library, not the script):

<pre>
sudo apt-get libgmic-dev
</pre>

If you want to enjoy the fruits of librtprocess, the nascent effort to package the Raw Therapee
demosaic routines, you'll at present need to compile and install librtprocess from a github clone:

https://github.com/CarVac/librtprocess

Instructions to do so are in the librtprocess README.  Once you've done that, you'll be able to use
-DLIBRTPROCESS=ON in rawproc's cmake command.  Otherwise, the demosaic tool will only allow the
internal algorithms half, half_resize, and color.

The above will put the librtprocess include file, library, and cmake FIND module in /usr/local.  

## Building rawproc

cd over to the rawproc directory and
do the following:

<pre>
$ mkdir build-linux
$ cd build-linux
$ cmake -DLIBRTPROCESS=ON -DGMIC=ON..
$ make
$ make doc
$ sudo make install
</pre>

...and there you go, rawproc, img, wxcmd, and exif binaries will be installed in /usr/local/bin.

If you want librtprocess and have installed librtprocess, put `-DLIBRTPROCESS=ON` in the cmake command before the ".."

If you want G'MIC and have installed libgmic, put `-DGMIC=ON` in the cmake command.

if you want in-program lensfun update and have installed libcurl and libarchive, put `-DLENSFUNDBUPDATE=ON` in the cmake command.

## Building Alternate Libaries With rawproc

The rawproc cmakek build system is set up to also build selected libraries in lieu of using system-installed libraries.  For a given library, a BUILD_(library) option is set ON to kick off a download/build/incorporate task in the rawproc build invocation.  To configure that, structure the cmake  invocation thusly:

<pre>
$ cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DBUILD_LENSFUN=ON ..
</pre>

and, when 'make' is subsequently invoked, the lensfun github repository will be cloned, lensfun will be built, and the includes and libraries will 
be made available to the rawproc build.  

The available BUILD_ options are:

- BUILD_LCMS2 
- BUILD_LENSFUN 
- BUILD_LIBRAW
- BUILD_EXIV2 
- BUILD_LIBRTPROCESS 

Some of the libraries are git-cloned, some are downloaded from the appropriate release page.  Regarding building, some are built with CMake, some are built with GNU autotools configure.  The detrimental implication of the autotools builds is that the library configure commands are executed everytime rawproc is make-ed, which significantly impacts the rawproc build time.  If you're building rawproc once to use, this is probably not a problem.

The various library versions downloaded have been picked to be the most recent available.  This is hard-coded in the CMakeLists.txt file, but should be easy enough to find to change.

## Setting Up Alternate Libraries Externally

rawproc's cmake build system is set up to find libraries installed with pkg-config .pc files.  Accordingly, pkgconfig can be compelled to search an alternate library directory to find self-built libraries outside the system library structure.  To do this, one only has to download and build the selected libraries, and install them to a separate library directory.  Then, run the cmake configuration with the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable altered to prepend the separate library directory to the variable contents.  Here are the steps to do this:

1. Make a "build-support" directory somewhere to hold the alternate packages and the alternate library directory:

<pre>
$ mkdir build-support
</pre>

2. In the build-support directory, unpack or git clone the desired libraries.  We'll use lensfun as an example:

<pre>
$ cd build-support
$ git clone https://github.com/lensfun/lensfun
</pre>


3. Build the library per its particular instructions, but add an install prefix path to the cmake invocation:

<pre>
$ cd lensfun
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../usr ..
</pre>

4. install the library:

<pre>
    $ make install
</pre>

Do 1-4 for each subsequent desired library.  After that's done, in build-support will be a usr/ directory containing lib and include subdirectories.

Now, when building rawproc, it helps to write a shell script to capture the configuration.  Particularly, modify the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH to start with the path to the build-support/usr directory.  Here's the script I use to do this:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash

#Sets compile flags in every compile command:
export CFLAGS="-ggdb -Wno-deprecated-declarations"
export CXXFLAGS="-ggdb  -Wno-deprecated-declarations"

#Prepends the alternate library directory to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/c/msys64/home/glenn/ImageStuff/rawproc10/build-support/usr/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
echo $PKG_CONFIG_PATH

#If 'clean' is specified in the script invocation, clean the build directory except for the configure.sh (this) file
if [ "$1" == 'clean' ]; then
        find . ! -name 'configure.sh' -type f -exec rm -f {} +
fi

#cmake invocation:
cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DLIBRTPROCESS=ON -DLENSFUN_DBUPDATE=ON  ..
</pre>

CMake will now find the alternate libraries first, but still find the distro-installed libraries.  You can do this for all 
libraries except for wxWidgets; if you have compiled an alternate wxWidgets, WXDIR is to be used to specify the path to 
the built library directory containing the wx-config program, like this:

    $ cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DWXDIR=/path/to/wxWidgets-3.X.Y/build ..

Note that librtprocess also requires specifying `-DLIBRTPROCESS=ON` in the cmake invocation to incorporate the library.

## Other Tasks (not current)

If you're building from source in either Linux or MSYS2, you'll also need to build and manually install your configuration and help files.  In the build directory:

<pre>
$ make docpages
$ make doc
$ make conf
$ sudo cp src/rawprocdoc.zip /usr/local/bin/.
$ mkdir ~/.rawproc
$ cp src/rawproc.conf ~/.rawproc/.
</pre>

Right now, rawproc will only look for its help file in the directory containing the executable.  rawproc will look for 
a rawproc.conf in a few places, but the best place to put it is in a ~/.rawproc directory (linux).  Future versions will use that
directory as a default for other stuff, like cms.profilepath and the lensfun database.

# Notes

1. Lens correction using the lensfun library requires particular attention to where the lens correction database is stored.
As of Version 1.0Dev, I recommend setting the tool.lenscorrection.databasepath to a suitable place and using the Update Data... menu selection to pull the most recent version from the lensfun server.

2. Color management requires the user to specify a profile directory, and in that directory shall go all profiles used, 
camera, working, and display/output.  rawproc doesn't use the operating system color management facilities.
