<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>rawproc is a simple raw image processor, primarily designed to open raw camera files and do basic 
manipulations in a wide-gamut, floating point tonal range.  I downloaded a lot of raw processors that will do this very 
thing, but most either came with a lot of other processing or GUI baggage, or were too simple for interactive 
use.  So now I have a program that does just what I need and only what I 
need.  My main use case is, sitting in the hotel in the evening, be able to go through my day's images and 
do what I call 'contact sheet' processing; that is, make decent images from the raw files for internet 
posting, and later use as the basis for 'real' processing using RawTherapee or GIMP.</p>

<p>One key feature of rawproc is my approach to non-destructive editing.  rawproc will open camera raw files, 
but it will not save to them.  It saves TIFF and JPEG image files, and it will write the string of 
manipulation commands used to produce the image file from the originally opened image into the saved image's
EXIF metadata.  You can later use a special open command to open the saved image by opening the original 
image and apply the manipulations to get to the saved image equivalent.  No separate sidecar files.  The 
command string also serves as the equivalent to the dodge and burn notes of a contact sheet or test image; 
they allow me to apply the same or approximate set of manipulations when I go to do the 'real' editing in 
RawTherapee or GIMP.</p>

<p>rawproc source code can be downloaded from GitHub, <a href=https://github.com/butcherg/rawproc>
https://github.com/butcherg/rawproc</a>.  rawproc will compile to a Windows executable with the MinGW C++ compiler, 
or to a Linux/GTK executable with the GNU g++ compiler. See the Readme.md file in the source tree (or displayed at
the github repo page) for more build information.</p>

<p>rawproc is by no means a tool you should use for serious image processing.  It does most of its
manipulation on the entire RGB data, no luminance-specific processing.  But any image opened
in rawproc is converted to floating point RGB and stays that way until saved in one of the supported image
formats, preserving 
the tone range as much as possible.  I'll have no qualms about using rawproc to create TIFFs for later
editing in a more capable program.  It uses the libraw library to open camera raw files, so you are availed 
of the fine work that went into the demosaic and all other processing operations contained therein. 
rawproc started life using the FreeImage library; as of 0.5, that library was replaced with one I wrote specifically 
for rawproc, called gImage, found at <a href=https://github.com/butcherg/gimage>
https://github.com/butcherg/gimage</a>.  It implements all the image operations as floating point, as well as supporting 
every processing option exposed in LibRaw and input-to-output color management. The significant and 
unanticipated benefit of the research required to develop gImage was to develop a really deep understanding of digital imaging and 
software development to support it.</p>

<p>All that said, I'm posting rawproc binaries and source code but I'm not planning on 'supporting' it as 
a product.  In other words, you get what you see, no more.  Further, there are still crash-instigating 
bugs that I have yet to fix, so save often.  So, use at your own peril, but have fun... <p>
