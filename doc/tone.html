<h3 id="Tone">Tone</h3>
<p>Applies the selected tone curve to the image.  This is just a somewhat random selection of functions, mainly for messing
with.  I still use a manually-constructed per-image curve for my tone transforms, but some of these hold promise if used in 
the right place.</p>
<p align=center><img src=tone.png></img></p>

<p>Available tone operators:
<ul>
<li>gamma: The same function as in the original gamma tool, which will eventually be removed.  Default: 1.0, or no-change.</li>
<li>reinhart: Applies the simple Reinhart function, val / (1-val), to either the individual channels, or as a computed 
change to the luminance of each pixel.  Default: channel.</li>
<li>loggamma: The HEVC version of the ARIB STD-B67 algorithm, as defined in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Log-Gamma.</li>
<li>filmic: The filmic algorithm is the original one, attributed to HP Duiker, copied from John Hable's blog: <pre>
R(x) = pow((x(6.2x+.5))/(x(6.2x+1.7)+0.06),2.2)
</pre>  
rawproc parameterizes the coefficients as follows: 
<pre>
y = pow((x(Ax+B))/(x(Ax+C))+D,Power)
</pre>

Usage notes:
<ul>
	<li>The Power coefficient is really a gamma, used in Hable's blog post to compare filmic to Reinhard.  
	Setting it to 1.0 nulls its effect.</li>
	<li>A affects the middle part of the curve.</li>
	<li>B affects the toe of the curve, flattening it as the value is reduced.</li>
	<li>C affects the shoulder of the curve.</li>
	<li>D inversely affects the middle part of the curve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The curve plot at the bottom of the tool pane graphically depicts the chosen tone curve.  The curve is computed using the 
actual tone curve operation, applied to a synthetic one-row image with monotonically increasing tone values from 0.0 - 1.0.
The curve can be zoomed using the mouse scroll wheel; Shift-scroll and Ctrl-scroll increase the zoom rate by 10 and 100, respectively.
The zoom scale can be reset to 1.0 by double-clicking in the curve plot.
</p>

<p>The norm checkbox enables/disables normalization to 0.0 - 1.0 of reinhard and filmic, which by themselves never reach 1.0.
The loggamma operator does this by definition, per the HEVC specification.  gamma is hard-coded to normalize.
