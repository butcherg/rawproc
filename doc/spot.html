<h3 id="Spot">Spot</h3>
<p>The spot tool offers the ability to correct spots in the image using a clone operation. The user can select multiple spot centers and associated clone areas, and the area around the selected spot will be replaced by the clone selection.
<p>

<p>After the spot tool is added to the toolchain, the user selects spots on the image display by holding down the Ctrl key and
clicking the center of the spot with the left mouse button.  Then, the user moves the mouse to the center of the clone area and 
selects it by holding down the Shfit key and clicking the left mouse button.  After the clone area is selected, the tool is set to allow selection of the next spot/clone.  Spots are marked on the display by a cross over the spot center, clone areas by a circle of the clone area.
</p>

<p>When a clone area is selected, its radius is constructed from the Radius parameter in the parameters pane.

<p>As spot/clone pairs are selected, they are added to the list kept in the tool paramters panel. A spot/clone pair can be deleted by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking the left mouse button at the spot center.</p>
