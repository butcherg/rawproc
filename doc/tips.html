<ul>

	<li>As of version 0.9, here is my raw processing workflow:

		<ol>
			<li>Copy my day's NEFs to "a directory named for the event/NEFs"</li>

			<li>Run a scrip called 'procpix' in that NEFs directory, which 1)processes each NEF to a 'proof JPEG',
			that is, a 800x600 JPEG with the processing toolchain embedded in the metadata, and 2) generates
			a thumbnail for each JPEG, stored in "a directory named for the event/thumbs".  I use the img
			command line program that comes with rawproc.  The img command to produce the proof looks something 
			like this:
<pre>
img "*.NEF:rawdata=crop group:colorspace:camera,assign;subtract:camera;whitebalance:camera;demosaic:half group:blackwhitepoint:rgb;resize:800;sharpen:1 "../*.jpg"
</pre>
			<li>Review the proofs; if any need correcting, or if I see an alternate rendition, I Open->Source 
			the JPEG in rawproc; it finds the NEF, opens it, and re-applies the processing from the JPEG to
			use as a starting point.  When I save this update, I'll either save it over the original proof JPEG
			if it still looks substantially like the original proof, or I'll append the filename with some 
			descriptor of what the difference is, e.g. DSC_0001-fullsize.jpg for a full sized rendition.</li>

		</ol>

		<p>The individual parts of the img command line bear discussion:
			<ul>
				<li>"*.NEF:rawdata=crop": First, the quotes are necessary to keep the command line
				shell from expanding the wildcard; rawproc does that.  Second, the rawdata=crop tells
				rawproc to just deliver the raw data (dcraw -D), and the crop value tells rawproc to
				crop the unexposed margins from the data (the margins for the particular camera are
				specified in the metadata)</li>

				<li>group (the first one): The remaining string until the next space is to be treated 
				as a group.  This means nothing to img, which applies each tool the same way either in 
				a group or by itself, but the resulting processing string tells rawproc to apply it all 
				as a single group.  This particular group contains all the processing required to 
				produce the starting RGB image:

				<ul>

				<li>colorspace:camera,assign: This tool looks up the camera color profile and assigns 
				it to the image.  "camera" keeps you from having to specify something specific, letting 
				rawproc look it up; you can use the same group with different cameras.</li>

				<li>subtract:camera: This tool subtracts the camera black number from the metadata from 
				the image.  Some cameras specify it, some don't; the metadata value for cameras that don't
				use it is 0, so you can specify it and not worry about whether or not...</li>

				<li>whitebalance:camera: This tool does white balance correction using the 'as-shot' 
				multipliers specified in the metadata.  rawproc knows the difference between a bayer
				mosaic and a RGB image, and the correct pattern is applied to do the multiplication.</li>

				<li>demosaic:half: This tool applies the so-called 'half' demosaic algorithm to the image.
				This does not produce the best quality mosaic, but it's darned fast and thus well-suited 
				to proof work.  The resulting image is half the size of the original, so it is a step 
				in the eventual direction to resize to 800x600.</li>

				</ul>
				</li>

				<li>group (the second one): This group contains the tools to turn the starting RGB 
				image into the proof JPEG.  The particular tools applied in this group bear some 
				discussion, below.</li>

			</ul>


		<p>I'm still considering how to best use groups, but here's where my head is currently at.  First, you'll 
		notice the image is probably a bit dark and the histogram is bunched up to the left.  The main reason for 
		this is the difference in scaling between the raw file's original values and rawproc's internal 
		representation.  Libraw delivers the raw image data as unsigned 16-bit integers, whether the raw data was 
		10-, 12-, or 14-bit data.  rawproc converts that data to floating point in the range 0.0 to 1.0, respecting 
		the relationship of floating point 1.0 to the unsigned 16-bit maximum of 65535.  So, for a 14-bit raw file, 
		the maximum integer value in the data will be 16383 (ignoring camera specific shenanigans), which in 0.0-1.0 			floating point converts to 0.25.  This may seem wrong, but it actually is a good thing in that it provides 
		room for the image to 'grow' as tools are applied.</p>

		<p>For proofing purposes, the second group scales the data to the floating point 1.0 'display white' per
		the previous discussion, resizes the image to 800 pixels on its longest side, and applies minimal 
		sharpening (output sharpening, to restore some acuity). 
		</p>

		<p>In rawproc, you can go a number of ways with this subsequent processing.  You might be satisfied with the image 
		tone and color, so you can simply insert tools between the two groups, e.g., crop.  But a lot of times the 
		processessing can be improved; I'll frequently break up the second group to change the blackwhitepoint
		scaling, which doesn't yet handle camera saturation clipping very well.  Or, I'll want to do some sort
		of tone scaling to pull up the shadows, so I'll delete the blackwhitepoint tool and replace it with a 
		curve, or one of the tone operators.  If your camera profile doesn't behave well (Elle Stone has a good
		article on that), you should probably insert a colorspace tool to convert to a working profile right after
		demosaic, before you do anything else to the image.  The basic point is, you can insert or delete tools
		to your heart's content, to the image's benefit or detriment...  :D</p>

		<p>You'll note that I've left out some things others might consider essential, lenscorrection, for instance.
		You can easily add this in, either as part of a group or by itself.  My processing is sufficient for 
		my current needs, and I wanted to keep this discussion simple...</p>

<hr>

	<li>While the program is named rawproc, it works well for editing JPEGs, PNGs and TIFFs too. </li><br>
	<li>rawproc tools are mostly multithreaded and compiled with as much optimization as is tolerable.  However, 
		Denoise is a slow tool that becomes unbearably slow with big images; consider using it 
		after resizing the image smaller.  Alternatively, try the libraw wavelet_denoise parameter; it is pretty quick and produces quality denoise...</li><br>
	<li>Curves work best if the change is small.  Avoid shallow slopes, as they collapse large (rich) tone ranges into very
		small (dull) ones.</li><br>
	<li>My personal experience with sharpening is that it is most useful after a reduction resize, as image clarity
		is usually lost even with the best resize algorithms.  After a resize, add a sharpen tool and bump it to 1, note the
		improvement.  In most cases values of 2 or greater have little marginal benefit at the expense of introducing
		halos around the edges.</li><br>
	<li>All the tools are multithreaded.  The default is to use all the available cores, e.g., tool.sharpen.cores=0, but 
		the specific number can be specified for each tool in the Properties list.  Using a negative number uses
		the max available minus that number, which can be useful for reserving a core for UI processing, e.g., 
		tool.denoise.cores=-1.  This can be handy with certain operating systems to allow interactive work to continue
		while an image tool is processed.</li><br>
	<li>The Re-open menu selection was implemented specifically for use with the LibRaw parameters.  The raw file can
		be opened with a set of parameters, and if something needs to be adjusted/added/omitted, the Properties parameter
		can be modified and the image re-opened to apply it.</li><br>
	<li>When you edit properties, use the filter to isolate the relevant ones.  For example, just type "curve" in the 
		filter, and only the parameters with "curve" in the name will be displayed.  Makes it easier to find 
		parameters.</li><br>
	<li>You don't have to use the white balance tool, you can use per-channel curves to do the correction.
		You can get an approximation of a white tone by zooming to 100%, running the mouse over a known white
		area and observing the RGB values.  It helps to have the display.rgb.scale set to 256.  Look for either
		the red or blue channel to be observably different from the other two, then add a curve for that channel and 
		drag the upper limit control point down the right side to reduce, across the top to add, in order to bring
		the channel values up or down to the other two channels.  You can also usually see the channel offset in the
		histogram; drag the upper limit control point down or accross to bring the upper part of that channel's 
		histogram plot in line with the other two.</li><br>
	<li>You can apply tools in any order you wish, but some orders are less beneficial than others.  This is why other
		programs such as DarkTable and RawTherapee hard-code the order, but I am more charitable to your whims while 
		less interested in your complaints...  :D</li><br>
	<li>Want to convert a color negative image?  Open it in rawproc and apply the following tools:
	<ol>
		<li>crop (to the relevant image)
		<li>blackwhitepoint:red
		<li>blackwhitepoint:green
		<li>blackwhitepoint:blue
		<li>curve (drag the 255,255 point over to 0,255, then the 0,0 point to 255,0)
	</ol>
	Pretty close... Oh, make sure you set tool.blackwhitepoint.auto=1 beforehand, so the blackwhitepoint
	tool computes the bounds.</li><br>
