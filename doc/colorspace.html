<h3 id="Colorspace">Colorspace</h3>

<p>Purpose: This tool is used to either assign a color profile to an image, or to convert the image from its
current colorspace to a new one.  This tool has two modes:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>profile file:</b> The edit box accepts one of the following:
<ul>
<li>a file name of a ICC or dcamprof JSON profile found in the directory specified in cms.profilepath, </li>
<li>a built-in profile, one of the following is valid: 
	<ul>
	<li>"srgb", "wide", "adobe", "prophoto", "identity" will invoke a dcraw D65 linear profile, useful for working spaces; </li>
	<li>"aces2065-1-v4-g10", "adobergb-v4-g10", "bt709-v4-g10", "prophoto-v4-g10", "rec2020-v4-g10", "srgb-v4-g10", 
		"srgb-v2-g22", "srgb-output" will invoke a binary ICC profile embedded in rawproc of the specified version and gamma.  
		srgb-v2-g22" and "srgb-output" are the same file. </li>
	</ul>
<li>a set of nine comma-separated integers, representing the dcraw color primaries for a particular camera.  For example, 
	the Nikon D7000 primaries are 8198,-2239,-724,-4871,12389,2798,-1043,2050,7181.  These can also be specified as a
	JSON array, e.g., [ 8198, -2239, -724, -4871, 12389, 2798, -1043, 2050, 7181 ]</li><br>
</ul>
which is then used either to transform the image from the 
previous colorspace to the new one (convert) or to attach the profile to the image as a representation 
of its current colorspace (assign).  Either a full file path name can be specified, or just a filename, 
in which case the cms.profilepath property is consulted for the path.

<p>The "Select Profile" button opens a file selector on the directory specified in cms.profilepath.  If a profile is selected
from this directory, the command will include only the filename; if the selector is switched to a different directory, the command
will include the full path of the profile.</p>

<p>The Rendering Intent selection allows one to choose the algorithm used to handle conversion of 
out-of-gamut colors.  Note that not all profiles allow use of all rendering intents; the LittleCMS 
documentation should be consulted for guidance on an informed selection.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>assign camera profile:</b>  This mode will use the image metadata camera make and model to look up a set of dcraw-style 
color primaries from dcraw.c, or RawTherapee's camconst.json, in that order.  Either or both of these files will be searched for
in the following directories in this order: 1) the pathname specified in tool.colorspace.*path, where '*' is either dcraw or camconst, 2) the
directory containing the rawproc executable, 3) the OS-specific application configuration path (same place as rawproc.conf).
If the image metadata contains a camera make/model, it will be displayed in the tool pane. </p?

<p>If one needs to determine if and/or where
the dcraw.c and camconst.json files are found, clicking the 'list' button in the tool pane will produce such a report dialog.</p>

<p>If a set of primaries are found, they will be displayed at the bottom of the tool pane.</p>

</li>
</ul>
