<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>rawproc is a simple raw image processor, primarily designed to open raw camera files and do basic 
manipulations in their 16-bit tonal range.  I downloaded a lot of raw processors that will do this very 
thing, but most either came with a lot of other processing or GUI baggage, or were too simple for interactive 
use.  Anyway, the FreeImage library allowed me to write my own application without having to deal with 
image formats and some manipulations, so now I have a program that does just what I need and only what I 
need.  My main use case is, sitting in the hotel in the evening, be able to go through my day's images and 
do what I call 'contact sheet' processing; that is, make decent images from the raw files for internet 
posting, and later use as the basis for 'real' processing using RawTherapee or GIMP.</p>

<p>One key feature of rawproc is my approach to non-destructive editing.  rawproc will open camera raw files, 
but it will not save to them.  It saves TIFF, JPEG, and PNG image files, and it will write the string of 
manipulation commands used to produce the image file from the originally opened image into the saved image's
EXIF metadata.  You can later use a special open command to open the saved image by opening the original 
image and apply the manipulations to get to the saved image equivalent.  No separate sidecar files.  The 
command string also serves as the equivalent to the dodge and burn notes of a contact sheet or test image; 
they allow me to apply the same or approximate set of manipulations when I go to do the 'real' editing in 
RawTherapee or GIMP.</p>

<p>rawproc source code can be downloaded from GitHub, <a href=https://github.com/butcherg/rawproc>
https://github.com/butcherg/rawproc</a>.  rawproc will compile to a Windows executable with the MinGW C++ compiler, or to a Linux/GTK executable 
with the GNU g++ compiler.  You'll need the FreeImage and wxWidgets libraries; I was able to install both 
from the Ubuntu repositories for Linux, but you'll have to download them from their source websites and 
probably compile them yourself for Windows.  The Makefile.txt will work for either Windows/MinGW or Linux, if
you have the directories set up right.</p>

<p>rawproc is by no means a tool you should use for serious image processing.  It does all of its
manipulation on the entire RGB data, no per-channel or luminance-specific processing.  But, each operation 
will work on 16-bit or 8-bit tone range (rawproc will open JPEGs, TIFFs, or PNGs for processing), preserving 
the tone range as much as possible.  I'll have no qualms about using rawproc to create TIFFs for later
editing in a more capable program.  It uses the libraw library to open camera raw files, so you are availed 
of the fine work that went into the demosaic and basic operations contained therein, although at present 
rawproc doesn't expose any processing option of that library.  FreeImage provides the basic manipulations, and 
I wrote the others based on how FreeImage works and a lot of internet research.  The significant and 
unanticipated benefit of this research was developing a really deep understanding of digital imaging and 
software development to support it.</p>

<p>All that said, I'm posting rawproc binaries and source code but I'm not planning on 'supporting' it as 
a product.  In other words, you get what you see, no more.  Further, there are still crash-instigating 
bugs that I have yet to fix, so save often.  So, use at your own peril, but have fun... <p>

<h2 id="Gettingrawproc">Getting rawproc</h2>
<p>A windows installer is here: <a href=http://glenn.pulpitrock.net/doc/rawproc-04.exe>http://glenn.pulpitrock.net/doc/rawproc-04.exe</a></p>

<h2 id="Installingrawproc">Installing rawproc</h2>

<p>Just run the .exe file you downloaded.  The installer will install rawproc and the .dll files it needs just 
like any other program.  It'll also put a rawproc.conf file in your c:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\rawproc\ 
directory; you can change various configuration particulars in this file before running rawproc.  And, if you chose 
in the install process, it'll put a shortcut on your desktop.  I recommend doing this, as you can quickly open pictures 
by dragging them from your Explorer window to the rawproc icon.</p>

<h2 id="Runningrawproc">Running rawproc</h2>

<p>It's really pretty simple, you can either run rawproc like you would any other program from the Start menu, or double
click the desktop icon.</p>

<p>You can make rawproc a lot easier to get to if you either specify it as the default program for the 
image types you want to work with, or getting it into the list of programs you get when you right-click 
on a file and select "Run With" from the popup menu.  Both Windows File Explorer and Nautilus in Ubuntu 
have a "Run With" menu entry that allows this.</p>

<p>If you put the rawproc install directory in your PATH environment variable, you can run rawproc from 
the command line: 

<pre>rawproc DSC_0001.NEF</pre>

will run rawproc and open the image file specified.</p>

<p>The -s switch is a unique rawproc feature.  If you've previously created an image with rawproc, it'll
save the command sequence used to create it in the image's EXIF.  Using -s to open the image will actually
open the image you started with (if it finds it in the same directory), and apply the tools in sequence to 
reproduce the image you intended to open:

<pre>rawproc -s DSC_0001.jpg</pre>

If DSC_0001.jpg was created by rawproc from DSC_0001.NEF, this command will open the .NEF file and apply 
the tools in sequence to recreate DSC_0001.jpg.
</p>

<h2 id="LayoftherawprocLand">Lay of the rawproc Land</h2>

<p>When started, rawproc will present you with a window containing three panes:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Display: The right-hand window, contains the image being manipulated.  There is also a thumbnail 
	window in the top-left corner that will toggle through a thumb of the image, a histogram, or nothing.
	You can toggle through the thumb modes with either the 't' key, or double-click on the thumb.  For the 
	display image, you
	can zoom in or out of the image using the mousewheel, or toggle 100%/fit by double-clicking
	the image.</li><br>

	<li>Commands: The top-left-hand window, contains the list of tools applied to the image.  You
	can select a tool to mess with by left-clicking it.  Right-clicking a tool 
	brings up a pop-up menu from which you can either display EXIF and image data or delete the
	tool; the histogram selection doesn't work yet. The checkbox beside each tool is to
	select that tool result for display; this can be done separate from selecting the tool to
	mess with its parameters.  I thought being able to do that would be useful, but the jury is still out...</li><br>

	<li>Parameters: The bottom-left-hand window, contains the tools for changing the tool 
	selected in the Commands pane.  These are mostly sliders that you can manipulate with either
	a mouse or a touchscreen implement (stylus, or your finger).  Sometimes, especially with Linux/GTK,
	the parameter tools won't display when you select a command; just resize the window slightly and
	they'll appear.  Something about Refresh() I need to figure out...</li><br>
</ol>

<p>You can drag the Commands and Parameters windows from their initial positions and dock them to various sides of the 
rawproc window, or you can let them float like independent windows.  This is particularly useful for the crop and 
rotate tools; you can make the Parameters window bigger to more easily work these tools.</p>

<p>Running, rawproc looks like this:</p>
<img width="100%"src=rawproc.png></img>

<p>There is also a status bar that will display useful feedback as you work with images, as well as the
display zoom ratio.</p>

<h2 id="MenuActions">Menu Actions</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>File->Open:</b> Brings up a dialog box in which you can select a file to open.  If you select 
a camera raw file to open, a radio box with options is enabled; these correspond to the libraw options, but
if you're opening a camera raw for processing, you want to stick with Default.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Open Source:</b> Brings up a dialog box in which you can select a file to open.  But, what then 
happens is that the selected file is inspected for a rawproc command list; if one is found, 
the original file specified in that list is opened instead, and the rest of the manipulation command list is
applied to the opened image.  The original image has to be in the same directory as the selected image.
This takes a bit of time, so be patient.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Save:</b> Brings up a dialog box in which you can specify a filename to save the image.  The
image type is determined by what extension you give to the file name, .jpg, .tif, or .png.  Save will
always bring up a dialog, whether you're saving to the same file or a new one.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Exit:</b>  Does what is says.  There is no prompt to save an unsaved image, so be careful.</li><br>

<li><b>Edit->Cut/Copy/Paste:</b> These menu items work on the list of tools applied to the image, so you can 
cut/copy a selected command and paste it elsewhere in the list.</li><br>

<li><b>Add->(tool):</b> Selecting one of the tools from this menu adds it to the Commands list,
after the selected tool.  See below for more enlightenment on the various image tools.</li><br>

<li><b>Help->Show Command:</b> Brings up a dialog box showing the command list that would be saved
to the image EXIFif you saved the file at that point.</li><br>

<li><b>Help->About:</b> Right now, this shows the rawproc description and version and the wxWidgets and FreeImage 
information for the included versions, as 
well as the directory containing the rawproc.conf file read at startup. </li><br>

</ul>

<h2 id="ImageManipulations">Image Tools</h2>

<p>Most tools have a reset button, that restores the default value to each associated parameter.</p>

<p>Most of the tools are based on a curve-generated lookup table; if applicable, the curve used to 
make the tool is illustrated in the descriptions below.</p>

<p>A note about the rawproc curve:  In both the curve tool display and the lookup table generation, the 
curve control points are specified as values between 0.0 and 255.0.  However, the curve control points and 
lookup values are floating point numbers, so the precision needed for each image type (8-bit: 1.0; 16-bit: ~0.003891)
is preserved.

<h3 id="BlackWhitePoint">Black/White Point</h3>
<p>With a curve defined as (0.0, 0,0, 255.0, 255.0), the sliders move the respective endpoint left or 
right.  This allows you to 'contrast-stretch' the image, making the pixel values use the full range available.  When you
add Black/White Point to the commands list, this tool attempts to find the ends of the image's tone range; if you don't like what it did,
you can manually work the sliders to a more satisfactory position.
<br>
<p align=center><table><tr><td><img src=bwpoint-curve1.png></td><td></img><img src=bwpoint-curve.png></img></td></tr></table></p>

<h3 id="Bright">Bright</h3>
<p>Uses the FreeImage_AdjustBrightness function to adjust brightness of 8-bit images, an equivalent function 
I wrote for 16-bit images.  The slider allows input of 
arbitrary brightness values between -100 and 100, 0 equals no adjustment.  FreeImage actually uses a 
curve-based lookup table to do this; with a curve defined as (0.0, 0,0, 255.0, 255.0), the slider moves
the upper endpoint horizontally for brighter, vertically for dimmer.</p>
<br>
<p align=center><table><tr><td><img src=bright-curve1.png></td><td></img><img src=bright-curve2.png></img></td></tr></table></p>


<h3 id="Contrast">Contrast</h3>
<p>The slider allows input of arbitrary contrast values between  -100 and +100, 0 equals no adjustment.  
Uses a curve lookup as follows:</p>
<br>
<p align=center><table><tr><td><img src=contrast-curve1.png></td><td></img><img src=contrast-curve2.png></img></td></tr></table></p>
<p>The control points are moved horizontally to increase contrast, and vertically to decrease it.</p>

<h3 id="Crop">Crop</h3>
<p>Allows selection of a portion of the image to be the new image.  In the display pane, northwest and southeast 
corner points adjusts the crop window to suit; dragging in the crop rectangle moves it around the image.</p>
<p align=center><img src=crop1.png> <img src=crop2.png></p>
<p>The northwest and southeast control points have two different behaviors; the northwest point (yellow rectangle) maintains 
the original image aspect ratio; the southeast point (red circle) allows free-form change of the crop box.  You switch 
from one to the other simply by dragging the appropriate control point.</p>
<p>Note: crop is implemented using the FreeImage routine, so it is not multithreaded, and will run slower than other tools.</p>
<p>Tip: Drag the Commands box out of it's docked position to make it bigger for more precise control of the crop window.</p>

<h3 id="Curve">Curve</h3>
<p>Allows definition of a tone curve to apply as a lookup table to the image, the classic curve tool.  Click on
the curve to add a control point, drag it to where you want.  Click on a control point to select it, it 
turns red.  Double-click the selected point to delete it (you can't delete the end points).  When you move 
a control point, the lookup table is applied when you release the mouse button.</p>
<p>If you select a point, you can drag your mouse (or finger on a touchscreen) anywhere in the pane to move it; you don't have 
to be touching the point directly.  You can also double-click anywhere in the curve pane to delete the selected point, 
holdover behavior from when I was trying to implement a touch interface.</p>
<p align=center><img src=curve.png></p>
<p>Note that you can move the endpoints on the top and bottom lines to adjust the black and white point, so
you could do that without resorting to the black/white point tool.</p>
<p>You can add as many curve tools to the command list as you desire.  Sometimes, doing something like using a curve 
to adjust contrast doesn't leave enough slope to do any other manipulations; just add another curve tool and go from there.</p>
</p>

<h3 id="Denoise">Denoise</h3>
<p>Uses a Non-Local Means algorithm as presented by David Tschumperlé, lead developer of GMIC, in his blog at http://gmic.eu.
The neighborhood and patch sizes are hidden in the configuration file, so the only control is sigma (denoies "strength").
This is a slow algorithm, so a default of 0 (no denoise) is appropriate to keep from cooling your heels waiting while
the algorithm walks the image when you initally add the tool.  sigma=35 is a good starting point for a small image.</p>
<p align=center><img src=denoise.png></p>

<h3 id="Gamma">Gamma</h3>
<p>The edit box defaults to 2.2, the conventional adjustment for linear raw recordings.  The value can be changed in
the edit box; hit the Enter key to apply it.  If you're working a raw image, this will usually be the first tool
you add, to stretch out the linear-recorded data to a range more approximating the behavior of human vision. Watching
the histogram as you do this is most instructive.</p>

<h3 id="Gray">Gray</h3>
<p>Desaturates the image to produce a grayscale rendition.  The default values of the three sliders are the 
conventional proportions used to 'mix' RGB values to produce a gray value of pleasing luminance.  The sliders
can be adjusted to change the proportions; the user is responsible for making the total of the proportions equal
1.00.</p>
<p align=center><img src=grayscale.png></p>

<h3 id="Highlight">Highlight</h3>
<p>Adjusts the high values without messing with the low values.  Uses a curve configured thusly: 
(0.0, 0.0, threshold-20, threshold-20, threshold, threshold, adjustx, adjusty, 255.0, 255.0), and 
the sliders adjust the threshold up and down the default curve and the adjust point up-left or down-right to
affect the highlight values:</p>
<p align=center><table><tr><td><img src=highlight-curve1.png></td><td></img><img src=highlight-curve2.png></img></td></tr></table></p>
<p>The adjust point will maintain a position equidistant between the threshold and the upper endpoint.</p>

<h3 id="Resize">Resize</h3>
<p>Resizes the image to the specified dimensions using the selected algorithm.  Note that the bit-depth is not changed.  
The default of 640x0
resizes the image to preserve the original aspect ratio with a width of 640; 0 in either parameter tells the tool
to maintain aspect ratio.  The default rescale algorithm was selected for good results; one might mess with 
catmullrom and lanczos3 to see if another is preferrable.  The display image is changed when you either hit Enter 
after changing a dimension, or selecting another algorithm</p>
<p align=center><img src=resize.png></p>
<p>Note: resize is implemented using the FreeImage routine, so it is not multithreaded, and will run slower than other tools.</p>


<h3 id="Rotate">Rotate</h3>
<p>Rotates the image, for straightening the horizon or a dominant vertical line.  The slider rotates the preview
image in .1 degree increments; use the star button to apply the rotation to the full image.  Note the black fill
where the rotated image does not fill the rectangle; if you plan to crop the image, save that tool for after 
rotation to also remove the black fill.</p>
<p align=center><img src=rotate.png></p>
<p>Note: rotate is implemented using the FreeImage routine, so it is not multithreaded, and will run slower than other tools.</p>

<h3 id="Saturate">Saturate</h3>
<p>Uses a public-domain function by Darel Rex Finley to change the image color saturation.</p>
<p align=center><img src=saturate.png></p>

<h3 id="Shadow">Shadow</h3>
<p>Adjusts the low values without messing with the high values.  Uses a curve configured thusly: 
(0.0, 0.0, adjustx, adjusty, threshold, threshold,  threshold+20, threshold+20, 255.0, 255.0), and 
the sliders adjust the threshold up and down the default curve and the adjust point up-left or down-right to
affect the shadow values:</p>
<p align=center><table><tr><td><img src=shadow-curve1.png></td><td></img><img src=shadow-curve2.png></img></td></tr></table></p>
<p>The adjust point will maintain a position equidistant between the threshold and the lower endpoint.</p>

<h3 id="Sharpen">Sharpen</h3>
<p>Sharpens the image edges.  This tool is really a digital unsharp mask, which actually increases the contrast 
of the edges, more appropriately known as acutance.  The algorithm used is a simple 3x3 convolution kernel, 
adjustable in strength from 1 to 10.  The 0 value is no-sharpen, so you can easily compare it and the lowest 
sharpening value by just rocking the mouse thumbwheel.</p>
<p align=center><table><tr><td><img src=sharpen.png></td></tr></table></p>
<p>The most effective use of this tool is to sharpen reduced-sized imsages; using the 
minimum sharpen setting is usually good enough for this purpose.</p>

<h2 id="Configurationfile">Configuration File</h2>
<p>A default rawproc.conf is installed in the appropriate Windows directory.  In it, you'll find a slew of configurable
items, such as the tool defaults, control point sizes, and logging.  You can change these with a text editor, then 
run rawproc to see the changes take effect.  At present, you can't change the configuration while running rawproc; you 
need to make the changes with the editor, then stop and restart rawproc.</p>

<p>If you run rawproc from the command line, you can make a separate rawproc.conf in the working directory and rawproc 
will use it instead of the installed file.</p>

<h2 id="Tips">Tips</h2>
<ul>
	<li>If you're processing a raw file, just plan to add the 2.2 gamma right off the bat, then apply black/white point
		to make the image tones fill the tone range.</li><br>
	<li>While the program is named rawproc, it works well editing JPEGs, TIFFs, and PNGs too.</li><br>
	<li>rawproc tools are mostly multithreaded and compiled with as much optimization as is tolerable.  However, 
		Denoise and Sharpen are slow tools that become unbearably slow with big images; consider using them 
		after resizing the image smaller.</li><br>
	<li>Curves work best if the change is small.  Avoid shallow slopes, as they collapse large tone (rich) ranges into very
		small (dull) ones.</li><br>
	<li>My personal experience with sharpening is that it is most useful after a reduction resize, as image resolution
		is usually lost even with the best algorithms.  After a resize, add a sharpen tool and bump it to 1, note the
		improvement.  In most cases values of 2 or greater have little marginal benefit at the expense of introducing
		halos around the edges.</li><br>
	<li>You can apply tools in any order you wish, but some orders are less beneficial than others.  This is why other
		programs such as DarkTable and RawTherapee hard-code the order, but I am more charitable to your whims while 
		less interested in your complaints...  :D</li><br>
</ul>
