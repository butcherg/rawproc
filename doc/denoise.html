<h3 id="Denoise">Denoise</h3>

<p>Purpose: Applies denoise to the previous tool's image.  Two modes:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>NLMeans:</b> Uses a Non-Local Means algorithm as presented by David Tschumperlé, lead developer
of GMIC, in his blog at http://gmic.eu.  The primary control is sigma (denoise "strength").
This is a slow implementation of the algorithm, so a default of 0 (no denoise) is appropriate to keep from cooling 
your heels waiting while the algorithm walks the image when you initally add the tool.  
sigma=10 is a good starting point for a small image.</p>
<p>The local and patch sliders change the so-called radii of the chunks of the image used to compute the denoised
pixel.  If you want to change them, refer to David's blog for definitions.  Changing these sliders will not update the 
image, only the sigma slider will do that.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Wavelet:</b> Uses the wavelet denoise algorithm cobbled snarfed from David Coffin's dcraw.c.  
The implementation of this algorithm is significantly faster than the NLMeans implementation.
</li>
